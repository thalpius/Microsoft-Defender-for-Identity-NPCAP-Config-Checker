# Microsoft Defender for Identity NPCAP Config Checker

Microsoft Defender for Identity uses NPCAP to inspect packets for malicious intent. Sometimes, NPCAP is not configured correctly for Microsoft Defender for Identity or NPCAP is installed by another program with different settings resulting in health issues reported by Microsoft Defender for Identity. This script will check the NPCAP settings which Microsoft Defender for Identity expects.
